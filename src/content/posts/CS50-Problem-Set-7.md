# CS50 Problem Set 7

Here's my answer for the CS50 Problem Set 7. Hope that will help you a bit.

## Problem 1: [Songs](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/psets/7/songs/#songs)

```sql title="1.sql"
SELECT name FROM songs;
```

```sql title="2.sql"
SELECT name
FROM songs
ORDER BY tempo;
```

```sql title="3.sql"
SELECT name
FROM songs
ORDER BY duration_ms DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

```sql title="4.sql"
SELECT name
FROM songs
WHERE danceability > 0.75 AND energy > 0.75 AND valence > 0.75;
```

```sql title="5.sql"
SELECT AVG(energy)
FROM songs;
```

```sql title="6.sql"
SELECT name
FROM songs
WHERE artist_id = (
    SELECT id
    FROM artists
    WHERE name = 'Post Malone'
);
```

```sql title="7.sql"
SELECT AVG(energy)
FROM songs
WHERE artist_id = (
    SELECT id
    FROM artists
    WHERE name = 'Drake'
);
```

```sql title="6.sql"
SELECT name
FROM songs
WHERE name LIKE '%feat.%';
```

```txt title="answers.txt"
1. I will use the SQL to count the average energy, valence, and danceability of a person’s top 100 songs from the past year.

2. I should consider how many times they listen to each music.
```

--Get the transcript from the reporters
SELECT transcript FROM interviews WHERE year = 2025 AND month = 7 AND day = 28 AND transcript LIKE "%bakery%";
-- Sometime within ten minutes of the theft, I saw the thief get into a car in the bakery parking lot and drive away. If you have security footage from the bakery parking lot, you might want to look for cars that left the parking lot in that time frame.
-- I don't know the thief's name, but it was someone I recognized. Earlier this morning, before I arrived at Emma's bakery, I was walking by the ATM on Leggett Street and saw the thief there withdrawing some money.
-- As the thief was leaving the bakery, they called someone who talked to them for less than a minute. In the call, I heard the thief say that they were planning to take the earliest flight out of Fiftyville tomorrow. The thief then asked the person on the other end of the phone to purchase the flight ticket.
